# My Portfolio

In this week’s challenge I’m given the assignment of creating my first portfolio from scratch which I’ll be using from now on to archive my projects as the course progresses. A portfolio of work can showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position, this will be a key part for my future as a web developer. 

In this Challenge I applied my recent coding skills and subjects that I’ve recently learned such as: HTML, media queries, flexbox, CSS variables and properties. I got to practice my new skills while creating something that I will use during my job search.
